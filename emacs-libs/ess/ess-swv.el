;; Some simple functions for ESS and Sweave
;; david.whiting at ncl.ac.uk
;; Wed Sep 1 14:55:52 CEST 2004

;; I have written some very simple elisp functions that I have found
;; useful and thought others might like to see. I dabble with elisp
;; occasionally at best so there are probably better ways to do what I
;; have done, but so far this seems to work for me. There are several
;; things that are hard-coded, I use Linux and I think that this would
;; probably not work in Windows (not as it is now anyway).

;; With these functions and key bindings all I need to do is open a .Rnw
;; file and, assuming R is running, I press:

;; M-n s to Sweave the file, then
;; M-n l to run latex on the results of Sweave, then
;; M-n p to make and display a postscript file , or
;; M-n P to make and display a PDF version.

;;; TODO:
;;;
;;; 1. I want to be able to send ess-makeLatex a parameter to tell it
;;; the number of times to run LaTeX (to get references updated
;;; correctly).
;;;
;;; 2. Also need to add ess-makeBibtex.
;;;
;;; 3. Might be good to have a way to chain commands.
;;
;; 4. ADD to the ../doc/ess.texi !!
;;
;; 5. add a sub-menu [Sweave] to the [Noweb] menu to teach users about
;;     the possibilities
